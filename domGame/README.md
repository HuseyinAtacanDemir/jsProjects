The Pig Game:
	Played with two dice, objective is to reach the target point. Open index.html and set the target point and the player names. No checks for xss are available at this point. So hack the game if you want :D.

GAME RULES:
- The game has 2 players, playing in rounds
- In each turn, a player rolls two dice as many times as he whishes. Each result get added to his CURRENT score
- BUT, if the player rolls a 1, all his CURRENT score gets lost; OR, if the player rolls two sixes at once, all his GLOBAL score gets lost. After that, it's the next player's turn.
- The player can choose to 'Hold', which means that his CURRENT score gets added to his GLOBAL score. After that, it's the next player's turn
- The first player to reach the target point on GLOBAL score wins the game
- Then the players can initiate a new game.# jsProjects
